Step 1
Wash and clean the carrots and green peas. Then chop the carrots in cube form. Now take a pan and add in water in it and then add peas to the pan. Allow the peas to get tender. Once that happens immediately transfer the peas in cold water. Drain the water and keep the peas aside.

Step 2
Heat water in a pan and put it on a medium flame. Then add noodles in the pan, allow them to boil. Once the noodles are tender add in the seasoning, the tomato puree and salt. Mix well with a wooden spatula and allow it to be cooked until the water dries out.

Step 3
Now take the cheese cubes and chop them into even small pieces, big enough to prick them with a toothpick. Then arrange a pea and cube of cheese on a toothpick. Repeat the process till all the pieces of cheese and pea have been arranged on a toothpick each.

Step 4
Transfer the prepared noodles in a bowl and top it up the the prepared peas and cheese sticks. Serve hot!
